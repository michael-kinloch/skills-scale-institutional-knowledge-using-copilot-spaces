# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

This README provides an entry point for all project management processes and roles used at OctoAcme. It summarizes our approach and links to detailed guidance docs for each phase of project delivery.

## Project Management Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative approach to project management, prioritizing customer value, clear ownership, and evidence-based decisions. Projects begin with a well-defined initiation phase, where the business need, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial risks are identified and documented in a Project One-pager. Once the initiative is approved, planning activities translate goals into actionable backlogs, timelines, and milestones, ensuring that dependencies and risks are clearly mapped out and managed. Throughout the lifecycle—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective—the team relies on standardized artifacts such as risk registers, release plans, backlog items with acceptance criteria, and definitions of done to maintain clarity and consistency.

Core roles drive project delivery through collaboration and defined responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and communications, while Product Managers focus on defining outcomes, prioritizing backlogs, and measuring results. Developers implement features according to acceptance criteria and participate in quality assurance, while QA/testing roles validate deliverables through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Stakeholders provide approvals and feedback, ensuring alignment to business objectives. This role clarity minimizes confusion, enables efficient handoffs, and fosters a culture of transparency.

Communication is systematic and frequent to prevent misalignment and surface issues early. Weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers, daily or twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates form the backbone of the regular cadence. Status templates and risk escalation protocols ensure risks and blockers are identified, communicated, and escalated appropriately, whether via daily standup triage or sponsor-level intervention for critical issues. Retrospectives and continuous improvement reviews after each milestone or incident collect learnings and generate actionable follow-ups, tracked in project boards and discussed in subsequent meetings.

Quality assurance is woven throughout the process, from pre-release testing and automated CI scans to manual QA and post-release verifications. Branching and PR conventions, inclusion of acceptance criteria, and mandatory code reviews further support code reliability. Smoke tests and security scanning are required before deployment, and rollback protocols are in place for incident management. By embedding these practices in workflows and documentation, OctoAcme ensures consistent project execution and continuous enhancement of team capabilities and outcomes.
